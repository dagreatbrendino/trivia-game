No matter the outcome, the player will be shown a gif relating to the question
### End Game
After every question has been completed, the player will be shown the total **correct answers**, the total **incorrect answers**, and the total **unanswered questions**. The player then has the option to play again. 

### Technical Aspects
#### Javascript & jQuery
The trivia questions are stored in an array called **questions** where each question is an object with the following properties: **q**, **correctAnswer**, **incorrectAnswers**, and **gif**
##### Example
```javascript
{
  q: "What is the name of Tony Stark's personal butler?",
  correctAnswer: "Jarvis",
  incorrectAnswers: ["Alfred", "Jeeves", "Hal" ],
  gif: "jarvis.gif"
  }
```
Question objects from the array are assigned to a variable **currentQuestion** with the **assignQuestion()** function 
```javascript
var currentQuestion = {
    disQ: " ",
    answers: [
        " ", " ", " ", " "
    ],
    timeleft: 15,
    funGif: " ",
    assignAnswer: function (ans){
        var index = Math.floor(Math.random()* 4);
        if (this.answers[index] === " "){
            this.answers[index] = ans;
        }
        else{
            this.assignAnswer(ans);
        }
    }
}
```
**assignAnswer(ans)** will be used to assign the **correctAnswer** and **incorrectAnswers** from the question object to a random index in the **answers** array of **currentQuestion**.
```javascript
var assignQuestion = function(){
    for (k = 0; k < 4; k++){
        currentQuestion.answers[k] = " ";
    }
    currentQuestion.disQ = questions[questionIndex].q;
    currentQuestion.assignAnswer(questions[questionIndex].correctAnswer);
    for ( i = 0; i < 3; i++){
        currentQuestion.assignAnswer(questions[questionIndex].incorrectAnswers[i]);
    }
    $("#question").empty();
    $("#question-gif").empty();
    $("#question").append("<div class='row'><div class='col'>" + currentQuestion.disQ + "</div></div>");
    var val = 0;
    for (j = 0; j < 4; j++){
            if (currentQuestion.answers[j] === questions[questionIndex].correctAnswer){
                val = 1;
                correctInd = j;
            }
            else{
                val = 0;
            }
            $("#question").append("<div class='row'><div class='col'><button class='playerAns' value =" + val + ">" +
            currentQuestion.answers[j] + "</button></div></div>");
    }
    currentQuestion.timeleft =15;
    $("#timer").html("<h4>" + currentQuestion.timeleft + "</h4>");
    timer();
}
```
After a question object from the **questions** array is assigned to **currentQuestion**, jQuery is used to update the question on the DOM. The correct answer is given a value of 1, and the incorrect answers are given a value of 0, wich will be important in determining the result of the question. Finally, the timer will be reset.
